Real-Time Concurrent Systems
SYSC 3303 Pong Game

This is a real-time multiplayer networked pong game. Following the MVC design 
pattern, the model is a C process done under Xenomai RTOS. The view is written
in Java (AWT) and controller is a C process. Windows and Linux machines can 
connect to each other for users to play. Additionally we implemented an 
external controller -- an Arduino microcontroller. With the microcontroller 
user can control the pong bar by tilting the accelerometer.
