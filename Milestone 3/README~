Milestone 3
___________

Caveat 
As with the version usage follows that of the previous milestone (Milestone 2).
The GUI must be run on windows because of the version of the JVM with RT/Fedora Linux.

Usage:

Usage is very trivial because our setup allows the average user to connect and setup. 
One should start the view on a Windows machine and then proceed to run the model (Xenomai). 
The model will take a command-line argument which is the ip address of the model. This is as follows
./model -i 134.117.59.142 
this would then connect the model to the machine with 134.117.59.142 i.e being the view. 

Secondly the various players (1 or 2 exclusively) must connect to the model, as follows
./clientsim -i 134.117.59.140
this is (134.117.59.140) the ip address of the model once this is done the game can be started:

To initiate game play the model will block until a player connects. Once a player connects the other 
player (if any) has 8 seconds to connect or else the model will timeout and the initial connected player will 
play against AI. 

If two players then the model will wait for one of the player(s) to press <space> and then <enter>.
<space> will add the pongs and <enter> will start the game. To quit the game only one or concurrently both players
will type 'q' without the literal quotes of course. The game will end with the state viewable on the view.
